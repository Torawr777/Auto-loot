Example situation:

You are working on an MMORPG.
Loot is very streamlined in your game. Whenever the player defeats a dungeon, 
all the loot they picked up is stored in a giant loot pile at the beginning. 
There, the player can choose what they want to take back to town with them. 
As long as what they carry is below their carrying weight, they can leave with it. 
However, players cannot leave with more than they can carry.

This project implements a way to automatically pick the best loot that the player can carry. 
This will streamline the dungeon-crawling experience substantially.

"autoLoot.c" -- Project implementation
